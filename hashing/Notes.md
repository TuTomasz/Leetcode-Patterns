## Frequency Counting:

- Use a hashmap to count the occurrences of elements in an array or string.
- Useful for finding duplicates, identifying the most frequent element, or checking if two arrays are permutations of each other.

## Two Sum Problems:

- Given an array of numbers and a target sum, use a hashmap to store the difference between the target sum and each element.
- Useful for finding pairs that sum to a target value.

## Subarray Sum Equals K:

- Given an array of integers, find the total number of subarrays whose sum equals a specific value (e.g., k).
- Use a hashmap to store the cumulative sum at each index.

## Anagram Grouping:

- Group anagrams together in a list of strings.
- Use a hashmap where the key is a sorted version of each string, and the value is a list of anagrams.

## Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:

- Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a string.
- Use a hashmap to store the index of the last occurrence of each character.

## Linked List Cycle Detection:

- Detect if a linked list contains a cycle.
- Use a hashmap to store visited nodes and check for duplicates while traversing the linked list.

## Union-Find (Disjoint Set):

- Use a hashmap to implement the union-find data structure.
- Useful for solving problems related to connected components or disjoint sets.

## LRU Cache (Least Recently Used):

- Implement an LRU cache using a combination of hashmap and a doubly linked list.
- Useful for efficiently managing a cache with a limited size.

## Word Pattern Matching:

- Check if a pattern matches a string, where each character in the pattern corresponds to a word in the string.
- Use two hashmaps to store the mapping between characters and words and vice versa.

## Minimum Window Substring:

- Find the minimum window in a string that contains all characters of another string.
- Use two hashmaps to store the frequency of characters in the target string and the current window.
